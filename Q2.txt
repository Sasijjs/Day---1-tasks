Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects are the representation of real-world entities in any language representing things by defining its properties along with 
their values. In Javascript, objects may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, 
in the form of “key: value” pairs.

Ways to create an object in javascript are as follows-

Object Literal
  object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing 
  it in a tidy package.
  var car={id:1 , name:’abc’ , display:function() }
  As evident from the above example property values can be of any data type, including array literals, functions, nested object literals, 
  or primitive data type.

  Object.create()
    The method creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.
    using the object literal example as prototype-
    var car2 = Object.create(car);
    car.id=2;
    car.name = ‘xyz’;

  Object Constructor
      Useful when we require to create multiple objects of similar type. In this case, a constructor (kind of blueprint) is created and 
      multiple objects can be initialized using the new keyword using the constructor as a wrapper for the newly created objects.

      creating objects using constructor-
        var p1= new Person(“John”, 50, “blue”);
        var p2= new Person(“Sally”, 48, “green”);
